Simple gui with season 14 League of Legends map, role icons, and ward placement for basic game planning/explanatory purposes. Bubbles surrounding icons are not exact indicators of vision; they're roughly scaled in the same way that riftkit was. 

The source code is in python, and the exe was compiled using pyinstaller. I created the executeable so that the program can be used by those unfamiliar with python. To use it, you just need the dist folder. Please note, due to the compilation method, this is an unsigned executeable, and it will be flagged as suspicious. The process of getting a CA is prohibitibively expensive and outside the scope of what I would consider a hobby project. I test downloaded it, and scanned it with Windows defender before running, and it came up clean. Feel free to do similarly.
